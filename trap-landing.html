<h1>Hah! You fool!</h1>

<p>
  Links you click on the Web <i>say</i> they point somewhere, but their destination can be changed with Javascript upon clicking them. Though this link led to Wikipedia before you clicked, once you pressed the mouse button, it got redirected here, which is where you got upon releasing the mouse button.

<p>
  I haven't seen this trick used anywhere, but still, it's good to be generally safety-conscious: If you follow links on untrusted sites, don't give your personal information to the destination.
